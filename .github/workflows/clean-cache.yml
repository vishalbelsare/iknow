# Configuration for cleaning the GitHub Actions cache.
#
# Once a day, at 11 PM UTC, clear the cache of single-use items that are meant
# to be used only by 2 neighboring runs and will never be used again. This keeps
# the cache clear of items that we know we will never use again, reducing the
# chance that GitHub Actions will evict items that we still need.
